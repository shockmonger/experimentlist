** Expt 1 Pitch discrimination
*** Description: 
This experiment will focus on students being able to distinguish
between two pitches that are played consecutively. The students will
only to answer whether the two pitches played are the same or
different.

*** Skills:
Before being able to train the ear for identifying pitches, this
simple experiment will help students distinguish between pitches that
are far apart and the ones that are spaced nearer to each other.

*** Levels:


** Expt 2 Pitch Direction 
*** Description: 
This subsequent experiment focuses on being able to identify the
direction of difference of the given pitches. After the student is
comfortable telling two tones apart, this experiment will help them
understand whether the subsequent tone is lower or higher than the
first.

*** Levels:



** Expt 2.5 What are notes?
*** Description: 
This experiment will explain the concept of notes and
octaves. Students will learn to identify octaves and figure out how
notes played in a row sound. Different instruments can be used to
elaborate this. For vocalists, this may include clicking on the names
of svaras / intervals and then listening to them. Students will also
be able to play notes as scales with note names to familiarize with
the concept of naming notes.

*** Skills:
Before we move to interval identification, this experiment is a free
exploration of musical hearing.

*** Levels: 
**** 1. Free exploration with instrument and note names
**** 2. Free exploration hearing different scales and note sequences
 
** Expt 3 Pitch identification from same tonic
*** Description: 
Here we start to move to interval hearing and tone training. 

*** Skills:
Before being able to train the ear for identifying pitches, this
simple experiment will help students distinguish between

** Expt 4 Pitch identification from separate tonic
*** Description: 
While the tanpura is playing in another key, a different reference note will be given to judge another pitch interval from.  


** Expt 5 Identifying a chain of pitches
*** Description: 
This experiment will focus on students being able to distinguish
between two pitches that are played consecutively. The students will

** Expt 7 Khali and Taali
*** Description: 
This experiment is to explain the polarity between these two events in
Taal. The rhythmic and motional feeling of a downbeat and an upbeat
will be explained. Participants will get to freely explore and listen
to tabla sounds, and figure out the presence of khali and tali in the taals.

*** Skills:


*** Levels:

  1. Analyzing khali and taali in visual form
  2. Building larger metrical structures for khali and tali
  3. Splitting These structures into different laya combinations - aad, kuaad, bayaad
